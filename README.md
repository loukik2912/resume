# Loukik's Website

Hi there! My name is Loukik Parab.
I am a software engineer interested in all things Data - from Data ETL, Data management, Data Engineering, Cloud-based development to Data Analytics & Data Science!

I am currently pursuing my "Master of Science in Computer Science" degree at the University of Wisconsin - Madison in Madison, WI, USA. My coursework includes a mix of Systems, Databases & Data management courses such as Operating Systems, Big Data Systems & Data Visualization.

I completed my undergraduate degree of B. Tech. in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering from Vishwakarma Institute of Technology in Pune, MH, India which is affiliated to the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). My coursework spanned diverse domains across Electronics (Analog Devices & Circuits, Digital Systems, Signal Processing, Information Theory), Telecommunication (Data Communication & Networking, Analog & Digital Communication, Wireless Communication) & Computer Science (Data Structures & Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, Natural Language Processing). I was quite heavily involved in co-curricular activities of The Robotics Forum, the flagship student robotics club of VIT Pune.
